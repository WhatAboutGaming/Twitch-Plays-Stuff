I have to write the readme



This code uses only the N64 side of the GameCube to N64 Controller adapter

There's a lot of debug stuff in this code, but it's mostly functional,

And a lot of uncommented code, but I think it's kinda easy to tell
what's going on Check lines 175 through 178

That's where you set what the controller does
