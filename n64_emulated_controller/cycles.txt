.L2 - top of outer loop body

 3 cycles to initialize inner loop (loads Z into r18 and 7 into r19)

.L3 - Inner loop body

 2 cycles to lower the line

 7 cycles for condition setup
  2 cycles for 1 bit condition, continue below - bit is 1
  3 cycles for 0 bit, and jump to .L4 - bit is 0

.LM8 - Bit is a 1: low for 1us, high for 3us

 * nop block 1: 5 nops

 2 cycles to raies the line

 * nop block 2: 30 nops

 2 cycles to jump to .L5 - end of conditional branch

L4 - Bit is a 0: low for 3us, high for 1us

 * nop block 3: 36 cycles

 2 cycles to raise the line

.L5 - end of conditional branch - line needs to stay high for 16 more cycles

 1 cycle to subtract 1 from r19
  1 cycle to continue below
  2 cycles to jump to .L6 - end of outer loop body

 * nop block 4: 9 nops

 1 cycle to rotate bits of r18
 2 cycles to jump to .L3 - top of inner loop body

.L6 - end of outer loop body

 2 cycles to save r18 into Z (unnecessary)
 1 cycle to subtract 1 from r20 (must be length)
  1 cycle to continue below
  2 cycles to go to .L7 and exit the loop

 2 cycles to add 1 to r30 (Z pointer)
 2 cycles to jump to .L2 - top of outer loop bodys

.L7 - end of loops, send a stop bit

 * nop block 5: 4 nops

 2 cycles to bring the line low

 * nop block 6: 14 nops

 2 cycles to bring the line high
